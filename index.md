# Who Are We?
## Software Development, Tailored to you
Here at **DByZ**, we specialise in software development for the 21st century. We'll work with what you already have and bring it forward, up to modern standards. We won't push you towards specific stacks, or languages - instead we'll provide you a wide range of recommendations tailored to your specific requirements, and we'll guide you through selecting the best solution for you.

# What Do We Do?
## Software Development
We work with a wide range of software, languages, and technologies. We will work with and create Frontend, Backend, and Process software, and are not tied into any stacks, languages or methodologies, allowing us to adapt to changing needs quickly. We provide not only the code, but the software setup too. Whether you need it deployed on bare hardware, or configured to run inside a predefined virtual machine, we'll get you set up.

# How Do We Do It?
## Tailored to you
We leverage our expertise across the many technologies to find the best solution for you. Our wide range of experience and expertise allows us to provide excellent integration across many systems, including any legacy and bespoke software you may need to be integrated.
